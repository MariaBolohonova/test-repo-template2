# FAQ about summarization in Copilot

These frequently asked questions are intended to help you understand the impact of AI on the summarization feature in Copilot in Dynamics 365 Sales.

## What is summarization in Copilot?

Summarization is an AI-powered feature of Copilot in Dynamics 365 Sales that provides sellers with a quick summary of important information about their sales records in an easy-to-consume format. Through this feature, Copilot can summarize:

- Leads, opportunities, and accounts.
- Proposals and other sales documents in SharePoint.
- Answers from SharePoint documents to questions asked in natural language.

Copilot uses language models and natural language processing to analyze and condense information in Dynamics 365.

## What can summarization do?

Summarization helps sellers stay on top of their **leads, opportunities, and accounts**. Learn more in [Get information from Copilot](./copilot-get-information.md).

It can help sellers **get answers to questions** about their accounts. When users ask a question in the Copilot chat, keywords that are detected in the question are passed to SharePoint to find documents that contain them. Snippets from the top documents are passed to Copilot to summarize and generate a response. Only files that the user has access to are considered for summarization.

It helps sellers **prepare for meetings** easily and efficiently. Summarization detects upcoming meetings in the next 24 hours on the seller's calendar. For each meeting, it summarizes the three most recent notes and the most recent email associated with the stakeholder's timeline, providing sellers with valuable insights and key points to drive productive discussions. They can quickly grasp the context and important points and engage with stakeholders more effectively and confidently.

It helps sellers **understand the gist of sales documents** that are stored in SharePoint. The summary helps sellers quickly understand key points and important details in the document. This feature is available for sellers who have access to SharePoint and have the necessary permissions to view the document.

## How is summarization intended to be used?

The summarization features are designed to help sellers be more efficient and productive. Here are some key use cases for summarization:

- Sellers get a summarized, at-a-glance overview of key information and important details about their leads and opportunities from multiple data sources.

- Diverse data streams enhance lead profiles with relevant data to help sellers gain a deeper understanding and efficiently assess lead quality.

- Summarized notes, emails, and interactions help sellers prepare for customer meetings with ease, quickly refreshing their memory, highlighting useful discussion points, and driving productive meetings.

- Summarized proposals and sales documents help sellers get to key points quickly without having to read through the entire document.

- Summarized answers generated by Copilot in Dynamics 365 Sales help sellers ask specific questions and get answers from SharePoint without having to leave their workspace and search the document.

## How was the summarization feature evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

We evaluate the effectiveness and impact of summarization using the following metrics:

- **Time saved:** Measure the time sellers save in understanding leads and opportunities and preparing for meetings compared to previous methods, quantified by analyzing the average time spent on these tasks before and after implementing the summarization feature.

- **Efficiency gains:** Assess the increase in sales efficiency by examining the number of leads qualified and opportunities pursued in a given time frame. Compare this data to previous performance to gauge the impact of the summarization feature on accelerating the sales pipeline.

## What are the limitations of summarization? How can users minimize the impact of these limitations?

Although the summarization feature offers numerous benefits, it's important to be aware of limitations that it might have.

- The quality of generated summaries relies heavily on the accuracy and completeness of the data in the system. If the input data has inaccuracies, missing information, or inconsistencies, it might affect the reliability and usefulness of the summaries.

- The account, lead, and opportunity summarization feature operates on fields and parameters set by administrators. Although it ensures consistency, it might limit the flexibility of sellers to tailor the summaries to their individual preferences.

## What operational factors and settings allow for effective and responsible use of the summarization feature?

To ensure effective and responsible use of the summarization feature, it's important to consider the following operational factors and settings:

- Make sure that the data in Dynamics 365 is consistent and high-quality, and regularly search for and enter missing data.

- Make sure that the fields that are configured for account, opportunity, and lead summarization are relevant to your sellers and align with their business needs to realize the maximum benefits of the feature.

- Make sure that sellers have access to the knowledge sources that are configured by the administrator for document summary. Also, ensure that the knowledge sources are reliable and up-to-date for accurate and relevant summaries.

## Which languages are supported by the summarization feature?

We're constantly working to add more languages to Copilot in Dynamics 365 Sales. View the list of supported languages for each Copilot feature in the [Copilot international availability report](https://releaseplans.microsoft.com/availability-reports/?report=copilotfeaturereport).
