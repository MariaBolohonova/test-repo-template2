# What's supported

Use the Dynamics 365 for phones and Dynamics 365 for tablets mobile apps to run Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) apps.

Install the Dynamics 365 for phones and Dynamics 365 for tablets mobile apps on your iOS and Android devices. 
  
## Supported devices for the mobile apps

|                              Platform                              |   Versions    | RAM (minimum)  | 
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|----------------|
|       [iOS](./install-dynamics-365-for-phones-and-tablets.md#install-the-apps-from-your-devices-app-store)       | 14 or later   |     1 GB (2 GB recommended)  |   
|     [Android](./install-dynamics-365-for-phones-and-tablets.md#install-the-apps-from-your-devices-app-store)     | 7.1.1 or later |     2 GB (3 GB recommended)    | 
 
## Install the apps 

To install the apps, go to [Install the apps from your deviceâ€™s app store](./install-dynamics-365-for-phones-and-tablets.md#install-the-apps-from-your-devices-app-store).


## Supported tablets to run customer engagement apps in a web browser 

For full functionality and optimized experience, we strongly recommend that you use the Dynamics 365 mobile app. If you don't have the Dynamics 365 mobile app installed, you can  use the web browser on your tablet to run your apps as long as your device has sufficiently high screen resolution.


## Supported tablets to use the web browser
  
|                              Platform                              |   Versions    | Minimum Resolution or Screen Size  | 
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|------------------------------------|
|       Apple iPad      | iOS 14 or later  |     9-inch screen (diagonal) or larger or iPad Mini with 7.9 inch screen      |           
|     Android tablet  | 7.1.1 or later |     1366 x 768 resolution (720p)    |         
| Windows tablet or PC |      10       |     1366 x 768 resolution (720p) |
        

Customer engagement apps running on a web browser on an iOS or Android tablet provides a similar experience to using it with a web browser on your desktop or laptop computer. However, some features aren't available on the mobile app or mobile web browser, including:
  
- Pinch and zoom  
  
- [!INCLUDE[pn_yammer](../includes/pn-yammer.md)]  
  
- Reports 

- Service Calendar 
  
- Customization/Editors  
  
- System Settings  
  
- Advanced Find  
  
- Process dialogs  
  
- [!INCLUDE[pn_skype_for_business](../includes/pn-skype-for-business.md)] presence  
  
- Entities that use classic forms such as Goal and Order Product see, [Entities using classic forms](../customerengagement/on-premises/customize/create-design-forms.md).

Once you sign in and launched an app, the language is selected based on your personal options or the base language in Microsoft Dataverse or Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises). If a language isn't supported, Engish is used.
